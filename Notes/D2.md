D2 is a declarative language for generating diagrams. It is focused on software architecture diagrams, and favors a clear and readable syntax. I'm finding it very nice to produce simple architecture diagrams that can be version controlled like any other code.

```d2
direction: right

classes: {
  animated: {
    style: {
      animated: true
    }
  }
}

Publishers: {
  1: Publisher 1
}

Subscribers: {
  1: Subscriber 1
  2: Subscriber 2
  3: Subscriber 3
}

Broker: {
  1: Topic 1 {shape: queue}
}

Publishers.1 -> Broker.1: {class: animated}

Broker.1 -> Subscribers.1: {class: animated}
Broker.1 -> Subscribers.2: {class: animated}
Broker.1 -> Subscribers.3: {class: animated}
```
