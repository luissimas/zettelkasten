From the [[Fish]] [design page](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/design.html):

> Every configuration option in a program is a place where the program is too stupid to figure out for itself what the user really wants, and should be considered a failure of both the program and the programmer who implemented it.

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) also leans towards the same idea. As an end-user it is really great when something just works out of the box without the need for configuration. Maybe this is also one of the underlying reasons to why I [[Switching to Ubuntu|switched to normal desktop environments]].
