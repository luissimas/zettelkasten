Headlamp is a [[Kubernetes]] UI that allows the operator to visualize and interact with cluster resources. It integrates with [[Flux]] to provide a [[GitOps]] dashboard. Installing it on my [[Homelab]] was very straightforward using the provided [[Helm]] chart.

A Kubernetes UI like Headlamp does not replace proper [[Observability]] tools, but it's nice to have a visual way to explore and interact with the resources.
