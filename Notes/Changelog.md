This is my personal changelog. The purpose of this is to track what I've been working on and what general topics I'm interested in at the moment. The goal is to be able to draw a high level map of I went about exploring various topics (as I have [[Managing multiple interests|multiple interests]]).

I started this changelog in 2024-12-30, and decided to not include anything before that because it's hard to keep track of things that happened in the past without writing them down, and that's the whole point of this changelog.
