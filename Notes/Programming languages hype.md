Today I came across a tweet with this graph mocking the current state of hype around [[Systems Programming]] languages. As a person that really likes to tinker with different programming languages and think about their design, this graph really hits me in a special way.

At the end of the day, languages are just tools, not a goal in itself (unless you are language designer). That is not to say that we should settle for bad tools, absolutely not! We should discuss their strengths and weaknesses of our tools, and always remain open to learn new approaches. With that said, we also shouldn't become emotionally attached to our tools, as this leads to bad decisions and unproductive arguments.
