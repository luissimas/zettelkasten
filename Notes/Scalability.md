Scalability describes how well a system can use resources to perform work, and how the _work capacity increases as resources are added_.

> A service is said to be scalable if when we increase the resources in a system, it results in increased performance in a manner proportional to resources added.

In [[Distributed Systems]], scalability can also be used to describe how redundancy and fault tolerance impact the overall performance of the system. In general, a service should be highly available with minimal performance loss.

Scalability is usually one of the goals of any good [[System design]], and generally cannot be achieved from a poor design. Achieving good scalability requires knowing the data access patterns, the expected growth rates and the physical limitations of hardware and network.
