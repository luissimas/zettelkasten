I really like [[How to learn|project-based learning]], but I also struggle with [[Shiny object syndrome|finishing things]]. The [[Zettelkasten exporter]] was the first project that I truly finished. The accomplishment I got from that is something that I've never felt before.

We usually have a resistance to finish projects because we **fear the feeling of failure**. An unfinished project has infinite potential, it _can_ be anything in a future that does not exist yet. A finished project is real, materialized, and thus it has the potential to not live up to our expectations or the expectations of others.

Moreover, unfinished projects take up mental bandwidth in the background, slowing us down on other pursuits. This is something especially relevant when we have [[Managing multiple interests|multiple interests]] and can't afford to waste any mental energy.

On the other hand, a finished project brings a sense of **accomplishment** that can't be found elsewhere. It is only with a finished project that we can truly **consolidate learning** and also share that learning with others. Thus, it is essential that we learn how to go about finishing projects instead of just pulling up more unfinished stuff onto our plate.

For me, the key points to ensure that I finish projects are:

1. Define what "done" means before you start. Be it an outcome, a minimal set of features or whatever else, the important thing is to have a clear definition on when the project is done. This is crucial to avoid scope creep and perfectionism.
2. Define a timeline for the project. This doesn't need to be a hard deadline, but it is important to define roughly how much time are you willing to allocate for that project. Without this, it's easy to end up with a project that goes on to infinity and is never finished.
3. Create small milestones. Breaking up projects into smaller tasks and milestones ensures that we can keep ourselves motivated by accomplishing at least one little thing every day. I find making consistent progress really important to stick with the project.
4. Celebrate completion. Making completion a celebration motivates us to reach it. Be it posting about it on social media or just sharing it with friends, celebrating the project and sharing it with others not only motivates us but gives a good sense of closure.
