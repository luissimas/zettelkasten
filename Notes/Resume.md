I'm Luís, a software developer living in Brasil 🇧🇷.I'm very passionate about a lot of things, som  of them are:

- Custom keyboards
- Text editors
- My computer environment (you can check my [dotfiles](https://github.com/luissimas/dotfiles) if you want)
- Developer tooling in general
- Getting better at stuff
- Learn more about linguistics and philosophy

This website is meant to be a place to share a few things, mostly through [my blog posts]({{< ref "/posts" >}} "Blog posts"). This page is mostly a resume of my professional experience and education. If you want to get in touch or discuss anything you can email me at <luissimas@protonmail.com>.

# Professional experience

## Cloud developer, Luizalabs (Magalu Cloud) (2024-Present)

I'm currently working at Luizalabs building Magalu Cloud: the first brazilian public cloud with multiple data centers. This was big change for me in both work environment but also in the work itself. Although still a developer, now I'm exposed to a wider range of topics that go from underlying hardware infrastructure to end-user product building.

## Software developer freelancer, Upwork (2023-Present)

In 2023 I started to work on a few projects sporadically as a freelancer. I felt that I needed more experience **dealing directly with clients**. Overall it's been a great experienced, I've done a few tools and migrations from services and databases. It's a very rewarding feeling to be able to **deliver value** by means of a complete project and get feedback directly from the client.

## Back-end developer, Liven Tech (2022-2024)

Liven is a software house in São Carlos, Brasil. Their clients range from startups to big companies in a variety of domains.

As a back-end developer at Liven I've started working mostly in the development of **REST APIs** in Node.js using Typescript and Clean Architecture. I also did a lot of work on **telecom platforms** in both Python and Node.js. It was here that I discovered that I really liked working with **infrastructure and application monitoring**, using mostly Prometheus and Grafana. Besides that, I did some work on **load testing** with Grafana K6 and optimizing performance in Python applications.

Furthermore, my time at the company has enriched my experience with Scrum practices, which are mostly applied in a small squad working on a project with constant change and development of requirements.

The work environment enabled me to start a **functional programming study group** with my coworkers. Together we developed an internal tool using Elixir and Phoenix LiveView. That was probably the experienced that sparkled my interest in **developing internal tools**.

## Software developer, CATI Jr (2021-2023)

In the beginning of my graduation I've joined a **junior enterprise** focused on building software solutions for local businesses called CATI Jr. The bulk of my work consisted in the development of **REST APIs in Node.js**, which introduced me to project management, patterns, documentation and **Scum practices**.

At CATI Jr we had a recurring problem of low knowledge retention on the company. We managed to collaborate on the **improvement** of both **internal documentation** and company culture of sharing knowledge.

# Education

## Pragmatic Studio Courses (2023-2024)

I took two great courses on [Pragmatic Studio](https://pragmaticstudio.com/) focusing on Elixir/OTP and Phoenix LiveView. With these courses I was able to fully grasp the core concepts in Elixir and OTP and develop a series of interactive UIs using Phoenix Liveview.

You can check out my certificates of conclusion at my [alumni page](https://pragmaticstudio.com/alumni/lu%C3%ADs-simas-l-sv).

## Introduction to Functional Programming (2021)

I've attended to a [UTFPR](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/) extracurricular course open to the community in which I had the opportunity to met people from different countries and learn a lot about the foundations of **functional programming**.

During this course I've [implemented](https://github.com/luissimas/analytic_tableaux) a method of proving classical logic arguments know as Analytic Tableaux using Elixir, including a simple propositional logic parser using the Erlang libraries leex and yecc.

Besides that, I've [presented a talk](https://youtu.be/rTL4TtpdjIE?t=1573) about the basics of OCaml and the joy of working with algebraic data types and pattern matching on a statically typed language.

## Computer Science bachelor (2020-Present)

I'm currently a undergraduate student in computer science, actively engaging in extracurricular activities and **extension groups**. It's also been a great opportunity to learn more about other areas that I'm interested in, mostly logic and mathematics.

## High School & Technical Certification (2017-2019)

I've attended to a high school that included an integrated technical course on software development. During this period I had the opportunity not only to **build solid technical foundations**, but also to engage in extracurricular activities, mostly in **cultural events**.
