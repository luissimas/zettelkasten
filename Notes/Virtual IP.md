Virtual IP Address (VIP) is a broad term that usually defines an IP address that does not belong to a specific physical machine and network interface. VIPs are widely used as part of [[High availability]] and [[Fault tolerance]] solutions for [[Linux]] servers. A common use case for virtual IP addresses is in the creation of [[Floating IP]] addresses.
