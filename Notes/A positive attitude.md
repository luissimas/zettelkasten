Having a positive attitude towards anything allows us to **enjoy life** even in its tough moments. I truly believe that our happiness depends on how we **act on things that we can control** and how we **accept things that we can't control**.

This is deeply related to the core ideas of [[Stoicism]]. Although recently these ideas seem to be more and more forced to people as a way to cope with the lost of hope in our future. Nevertheless, I'm still guided by these principles and strive to always face life with a positive attitude.
