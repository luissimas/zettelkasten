In the context of [[Software development]] and programming languages, orthogonality means that a small set of primitives can be composed to create complex programs. Generally, more orthogonality means less exceptions and more [[Simplicity]].

> Clear is better than clever

Languages like [[Go]] and [[Zig]] strive for simplicity and orthogonality (although Go has more exceptions than I'd like). Apparently [[Rust]] also strived a lot towards keeping a small set of primitives, but lately the language has been getting more and more complex.
