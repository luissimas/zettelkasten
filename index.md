This is my personal [[Zettelkasten]] containing some notes that I've written on various topics. Fell free to take a look.

> [!NOTE]
> This website is still under construction. I still need to figure out how to organize all of this and refine some notes, but done is better than perfect.

If you want to know what I've been doing lately, check out my [[Changelog]].

You can explore the notes by using the search bar or by using some of the [Indexes](./Indexes/). Once you're in a note, you can navigate to related notes using the graph view or the backlinks on the right panel. Here are some core topics that might be of interest:

- [[Homelab]]
- [[Kubernetes]]
- [[Rust]]
- [[Managing multiple interests]]
- [[Specialization is for insects]]
- [[Software testing]]
