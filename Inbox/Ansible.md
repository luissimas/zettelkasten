Ansible is not very picky and can work well with a wide range of both new and existing deployments. Unlike [[Juju]] or other solutions, Ansible is **agent-less**. This means that there's no need for any daemon service running on the servers that will be automated. Because of this, Ansible is a very low overhead solution.

Overall it seems that Ansible is a very good automation solution for configuring infrastructure. Its focus on [[Simplicity]] and ease of use result in an automation that is easy to maintain and extend.
