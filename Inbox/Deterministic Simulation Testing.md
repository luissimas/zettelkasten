Deterministic Simulation Testing is a technique for [[Software testing|testing]] [[Distributed systems]]. It consists of controlling all non-deterministic behavior in a deterministic simulator that is able to inject faults and most importantly: reproduce behaviors. This is usually implemented via dependency injection or even using a deterministic hypervisor.

[[Tigerbeetle]] does this.
