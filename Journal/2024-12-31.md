It's been a while since I last wrote anything on this journal, and I miss the clarity of thought that it gave me.

I realized that I must do the dishes at night instead of leaving them to the morning. Why would I defer a task that requires no mental effort to the period of the day when I fell most mentally sharp? The result of doing the dishes in the morning is that I immediately engage in content consumption while I do it, and I should be focusing on creating instead of consuming in the morning.
