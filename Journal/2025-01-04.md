Just got back from a quick run and I feel great. Running without music really helped me focus on my technique and control my pace.

Today I turned back my attention to the Incus charm, mostly exploring OVN integration and [[IPVS]] as a L4 load balancer. I got up to speed faster than I expected, and it was quite easy to context switch to it again. I'm not so sure about using [[IPVS]] directly via `ipvsadm`, I probably missed some firewall rule that caused my packets to be dropped. [[Keepalived]] also works as an interface for IPVS, so I might give it a go. With that said [[HAProxy]] worked out just fine, the main problem is that it does not implement [[Maglev]] and does not use IPVS for its L4 load balancing, so we'll be losing on performance and resilience (and maybe that's fine for a control plane load balancer).
