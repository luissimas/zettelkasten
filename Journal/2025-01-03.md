Did some more work on the [[Zettelkasten CLI]]. Now we can read a config file and also prompt the user for values on the first run, much like the `incus admin init` experience. The tool is now usable for creating notes on the user-specified Zettelkasten directory. My semester starts soon so I'll have less time to work on it, so development will slow down significantly. I'll probably turn my focus to Incus and its charm to get this done until the end of January.
