Did some work on the [[Zettelkasten CLI]] today. We can already create new notes and open them in the user's `$EDITOR`. The next step is to read the config files, probably using [confy](https://docs.rs/confy/0.6.1/confy/) and then provide some way to prompt the user for the required config values upon first launch. This is needed since the Zettelkasten root directory is very user specific, and there's no reasonable default value.
